    <h2>Account Collection Processing</h2>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      AC Processing has closed our doors in November of 2019. We'd like to thank
      our clients, vendors, associates, staff, and consumers for several great
      years. As many of you may know, our ethos has been to change the public
      perception of a very broken industry, treat consumers with respect and
      dignity, and our people before profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that we were successful in operating by those principals,
      although our legacy isn't complete.The founder of AC Processing is working
      on a new venture to help shape the debt industry from the outside by
      creating soultions for consumers to take back control of their accounts
      and finances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former head of AC Processing is creating tools for automation within
      the financial space. We believe that consumers should never have to be
      called about old debts. The technology to automate the account lifecycle
      management has existed in other industries for many years, the debt
      collection industry is trailing behind as is so often the case. Our time
      in business has shown us many flaws within this indsutry which have simple
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the coming years, our former management hopes to be the leaders in
      technology that will allow for you, the consumer to be notified about
      past-due accounts, negotiate the balance, repay (or dispute) the debt
      without receiving a single phone call. Managing your account without
      having your privacy breached, validating the account without being passed
      around a call center because your time is valuable. We hope to make the
      debt industry a less divisive place and right the wrongs of our
      predecessors who have given this industry a bad name.
    </p>
    <p>
      To everyone who has associated with us over the years, we thank you and
      wish you good health, happiness, and prosperity in the years to come.

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h4>I got a call from your agency, aren't you closed?</h4>
    <p>
      We are closed, but we are aware of another company with the same name who
      is located in a different state. Over the years, we had forwarded our fair
      share of consumers to their office after being contacted in error. If you
      see 'AC Processing' on your caller ID or Bank statement, don't panic, we
      recommend calling the phone number back and asking for documentation if
      you haven't already. We don't want to cause any confusion, however we can
      not disregard that there is a separate AC Processing still in business to
      the best of our knowledge as of November 2019. Always make sure that you
      know who you are paying, and what you are paying for.
    </p>
    <h4>
      I paid your agency between 2016 and 2019 and want another copy of my
      payment letter. Can you provide this?
    </h4>
    <p>
      We can not provide any documentation because 'we' are no longer in
      business however, you can send an email
      <a href="mailto:info@pastdue.app" target="_blank">ðŸ“§ here</a>
      to get information about who to contact for the correct documentation. We
      have been required to maintain a historical database of all consumers who
      had made payments. This database includes the original creditor, the
      current servicing party, the dates and amounts paid, and a phone number
      for the original creditor. We are more than happy to forward that
      information to you upon request.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save time, if you paid an account for US Bank, Comenity Bank, Discover,
      or United TranzActions, please contact them directly as they will have the
      information you are seeking.
    </p>
    <h4>Why did you close?</h4>
    <p>
      The simple answer is that the management staff was passionate about
      financial technology. AC Processing was always a means to an end.
    </p>
    <h4>
      I think I owe your company money for a past-due account, what do I do?
    </h4>
    <p>
      We contacted all of the active accounts several months before closing our
      doors to make arrangements. The accoutns were handled on a case by case
      basis. The accounts that were being worked on behalf of a third-party were
      returned to that third party. The accounts that we owned were more than
      90% settled by the time we closed our doors. We sent out letters to the
      last 10% to notify them that the remaining balance was forgiven. If you
      did not get a 'release letter', it is likely that your account was being
      worked for a third party.
    </p>
    <h4>Is AC Processing creating financial technology now?</h4>
    <p>
      AC Processing is not doing anything. This entity is no longer active. The
      former management staff have moved on to software and are actively
      developing communication tools that will be introduced to lenders, debt
      collection agencies, professional service industries, and consumers as
      soon as 2022 however, AC Processing is no longer in business.
    </p>
    <h3>Thank you all</h3>
    <p>
      From the banks and lenders that have worked with us, to the consumer on
      the other end of the telephone, we appreciate all of our interactions.
      This is the end of our journey through the debt collection industry
      however, the former management staff from AC Processing will continue to
      inovate for the greater good in all of our future endeavors.
